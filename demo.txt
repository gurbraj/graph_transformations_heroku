Ruby/GSL is a ruby interface to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), for numerical computing with Ruby.



require("gsl")

brew install gsl

###############################stoppen the GSL and went to SCIRUBY

https://github.com/sciruby/sciruby


https://github.com/SciRuby/gnuplotrb

Hope you love daru! For enhanced interactivity and better visualizations,
consider using gnuplotrb and nyaplot with iruby. For statistics use the
statsample family.

Read the README for interesting use cases and examples


/////////////////
Welcome to Nyaplot

 ___/|
 o.O|
 (___)
   U

Thank you for installing Nyaplot gem.

We strongly recommend you to install IRuby, an interactive
Ruby environment on web browser at the same time.

$ gem install iruby

If you wonder how to use Nyaplot, see /path/to/nyaplot/examples/notebook
and run `iruby notebook` in the directory.
You can find these notebook on your browser:
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/domitry/nyaplot/blob/master/examples/notebook/Index.ipynb

You can also use nyaplot without IRuby like /path/to/nyaplot/examples/rb
or on your browser:
https://github.com/domitry/nyaplot/tree/master/examples/rb

Feel free to raise Issue or Pull-request on GitHub.
Most pull-request might be accepted unless it is broken or too destructive.

Enjoy Nyaplot!

from   https://github.com/rdp/ruby_gnuplot   i am using the second one.

####################
create controller for every function
  for everyone of these controllers,
      can have different transformation controller (finds the function, applies transformation to it )      --  horizontal shifts, vertical shifts, amplification, stretches, all combos (this option requires submit before )

        horizontal shift works as follows: on h there is an j-query that sends an ajax req to the same controller but to a different function TRANSFORM, passes the parameter to it
          the function TRANSFORM makes new @x and @y and sends it as a json-object.



  1)have a create action that generates x,y, redirect to show.
  2)show contains the javascript that renders the graph.
        the javascript also has
          1)jquery on $('a')   that sends an ajax back to the controller, asking what function the user is on. pass
          2)  on success:


create a model that randomly sends the user to the different functions



#####TO DO

1) make it so that the scales are not responsive!  CHECK
2) when type in 22
3) radians for sin n cos
4) when zero, it makes it flat                CHECK
5) have the original graph showing on the transformation

6)  make the algebreic expression better. is hacky right now.


7) fix natural language
8) give some options to the user,   like : x-axis, y-axis    number of points?   color maybe

started on demos2(new rails project)

bin/rails g controller sin_functions

##########################################################

bin/rails g model function name:string

#todo
fix show all functions
fix activating the different modes (a button)
link to create

soundeffects
colors
xaxis y axis adjustment

comments? for users

bootstrap that shit

sinus radius n stuff
pretty equations
get the algebra-part on the show page

fix! compress by a factor of -2


###
questions:  why the - in x**2


######to do before presentation
horizontally stretched by a factor of 1/1/2 units -
clean and remove dead code
add tests
fix the "compressed by a factor of -1/3"
label x and y axis
think about what to say
why does the links in the navbar disapear

drop table? what function to use.

level-up
level-down
