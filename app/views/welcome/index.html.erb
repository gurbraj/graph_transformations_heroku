In British Columbia there exists a course called Pre-Calculus 12.<br>
A significant part of Pre-Calculus 12 consists of transforming graphs of functions.<br>
This application is meant to be used as a tool for mastering that part of the material by emphasizing the connection between algebra, geometry, and natural language.     <br>
<br>
Being able to transform graphs of functions is useful when it comes to modeling relationships between phenomenon in nature.

This application is deployed on Heroku. As a consequence, it can sometimes take a couple of minutes before the transformations start to work if the application have not been visited for a while.
